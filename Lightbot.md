## My Thoughts On Light Bot
Today I started using the Light Bot program. I have only ever tried proramming on Scratch, which I was terrible at and was more interested in doing art than coding. At first when I used Light Bot, I thought my experience would be similar. Instead, it started off really easy and was engaging and fun. Each level introduced or challenged me in a different way. As it started introducing new commands, the game got more challenging. Occasionally, I got stuck on some levels and had to use the cheat sheet for a head start, but would eventually figure the rest of the level out by myself. So far, I've gotten to the Conditionals level in the second verion of the game. I could not use the first version because there was some missing software from the computer. Nonetheless, I was able to start out perfectly on the second version.
